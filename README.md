# eo-core
A repo for core earth observation research


ROADMAP:
- materialize:
  - local materialize in cloud
  - eager materialze in cloud run dagster pipes
  - patient mterialize in dataproc dagster pipes

# EO-Flow: end-to-end Earth Observation DataOps

:construction: EO-Flow is currently under construction.

EO-Flow is a platform for end-to-end EO+ML (Earth Observation + Machine Learning).
EO-Flow aims to be the easiest and most cost-effective way to develop insights from satellite data, unlocking scale: large area, deep temporal, or high-cadence deployments.
With a low-code client library, and an accessible UI, EO-Flow allows your team to focus on the insight, not on the infrastructure.

- **Materialize** an ML-ready dataset into a cloud environment of your choice.
- **Train** a machine learning model on your dataset using an eo-flow dataloader
- **Deploy** your ML model on a (different) target area, trusting that your data
- **Visualise & Share** your ML inference with your team and stakeholders.

Materialize, train, and deploy jobs can be dispatched with either *eager* or *patient* priority. Eager jobs will execute immediately; patient jobs will make use of cost-optima pre-emptible compute resources.
